        <li>Start on your hands and knees, with your hands stacked under your shoulders and knees under your hips.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Spread your hands wide and press your index finger and thumb into your mat. 
          </li>
        <br>
        <li>Lift your tailbone and press your butt up and back, drawing your hips toward the ceiling. Straighten your legs as best as you can and press your heels gently toward the floor. 
          </li>
        <br>
        <li>Your head should be between your arms, facing your knees, and your backs should be flat. 
          </li>
        <br>
        <li>Hold for 5â€“10 breaths.</li>
